Despite a number of lineup changes, Dissection released The Somberlain in 1993 and Storm of the Light's Bane in 1995, before splitting up in 1997 due to Nödtveidt's imprisonment for complicity in the murder of Josef Meddour.After his release, Nödtveidt reformed the band in 2004 with new members whom he felt could 'stand behind and live up to the demands of Dissection's Satanic concept.'They released their third and final full-length album Reinkaos in April 2006, before disbanding that June. Nödtveidt said he had 'reached the limitations of music as a tool for expressing what I want to express, for myself and the handful of others that I care about.'Two months later, Nödtveidt committed suicide with a gun inside a circle of lit candles in his apartment in Hässelby.",
